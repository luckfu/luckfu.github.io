The following are some common situations:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Free hosting is over quota, free storage is over quota, oc priority to stop the resource is this A1.Flex vps ã€‚&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flex.A1 The optional operating system is only oracle linux v7 or v8 , if you like ubuntu&amp;hellip;ðŸ˜­&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the operating system is broken, unlike general cloud service consoles that can restore the image, you can only reapply&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Using a container as a virtual machine is not in line with the original intention of container application deployment, but in view of the above problems, docker is used to create a container instead of a virtual machine in this article. Everything is operated in the virtual machine. When the system disaster is unrecoverable, just delete container and Create the container again.&lt;/p>
